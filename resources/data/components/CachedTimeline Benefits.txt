CachedTimeline Benefits
- Delegates most of the implementation to JavaFX
- Enables rate changes, cue points

CachedTimeline Concerns
- Builder classes cannot be named to match key frame and value
- Requires the animation class to be constructed every time property used by the timeline is changed
- Unable to be extended

RtAnimation Benefits
- Less memory consumption (currently)
- Can calculate end values dynamically
- Can reduce the number of animator classes due to ability to compute end values dynamically

RtAnimation Concerns
- Lack of features, such as play rate, cue points, and number of interpolated frames (though probably implementable)
